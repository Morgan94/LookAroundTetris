##### My Own OpenGL Program #####

Main program and OpenGL framework have been created by Quentin Braem, Sylvain Lacherez, Morgan Lemiere and Benjamin Binet.

Here are the commands to play:
- Z to move the camera forward
- S to move the camera backward
- Q to move the camera to the left
- D to move the camera to the right
- A to move the camera to the top
- W to move the camera to the bottom
- Arrow keys to rotate the camera
- [1-5] to change the scene:
	- 1 = Diamonds with simple color, no lightning.
	- 2 = Sonic OBJ with texture, no lightning.
	- 3 = Diamonds with simple color and lightning.
	- 4 = Sonic OBJ with texture and lightning.
	- 5 = Final scene.
- ESCAPE to quit the application.

Enjoy !
